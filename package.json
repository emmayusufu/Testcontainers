  "description": "This repository demonstrates how to **automate integration testing** in **Node.js** using **Testcontainers**. By leveraging **Dockerized services** (such as PostgreSQL in this case), you can spin up isolated environments for your tests, ensuring that your tests are **clean**, **repeatable**, and **reliable**. Testcontainers takes care of setting up and tearing down external dependencies like databases, so you can focus on writing tests without worrying about environment management.",
